# Find the ZeroC ICE includes and libraries for every module (Ice, IceStorm, IceUtil, etc)

#
# ZeroCIce_INCLUDE_DIR - Where the includes are. If everything is all right, ZeroCIceXXXX_INCLUDE_DIR is always the same. You usually will use this.
# ZeroCIce_LIBRARIES - List of *all* the libraries. You usually will not use this but only ZeroCIceUtil_LIBRARY or alike
# ZerocCIce_FOUND - True if the core Ice was found
# ZeroCIceCore_FOUND
